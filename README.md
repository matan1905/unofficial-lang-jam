# Unofficial lang Jam
So this is a programming language jam but it's not by the original creators of the [Original jam](https://github.com/langjam/langjam) so I call it unofficial.
There are no prices, however there will be voting for the winner.

The jam theme is: **not yet announced.**

Bonus street cred if you could also include the theme: **NOT YET ANNOUNCED**

## Getting started
anyone can participate, if you or your team would like to add a submission:
* Create your own git repo with the project name, keep it family friendly.
* Create the best programming language in that repo
* Send a PR containing that repo as a [submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) 

submodules names are first come first serve.

Thanks to submodules magic, you could then keep working on your repo and when time is due I will update all repos to the latest submission.

## Your Project repo
Your project repo should contain the language source
To make everyone's life easier please include the following in your readme:
* Full instructions on how to start writing in your language
	* Build instructions
	* documentation
* Sample files written in your language (and what they do if it's a cryptic language)
* Explanation of how it relates to the theme

## Timeline
Starting: 14 May at 7:00 am UTC
Ending at: 21 May at 7:00 am UTC

## Judging
The judging will be done by the community using some voting site
winner will be announced 2 weeks after the jam ends.
These are the judging parameters:
* Language documentation
* Language Creativity
* Language Uniqueness

The bonus street cred in the bonus theme may also be a considering point.
